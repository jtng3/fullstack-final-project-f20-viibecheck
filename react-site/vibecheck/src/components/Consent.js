              While the legal definitions of consent may vary by location and
              circumstance, the general concept is always the same: Consent is
              an ongoing process of discussing boundaries and what you’re
              comfortable with. Let’s get specific about how consent plays out
              in real life.
            </p>
            <h5>
              <strong>What is consent? </strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
              Consent is an agreement between participants to engage in sexual
              activity. Consent should be clearly and freely communicated. A
              verbal and affirmative expression of consent can help both you and
              your partner to understand and respect each other’s boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consent cannot be given by individuals who are underage,
              intoxicated or incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, or asleep or
              unconscious. If someone agrees to an activity under pressure of
              intimidation or threat, that isn’t considered consent because it
              was not given freely. Unequal power dynamics, such as engaging in
              sexual activity with an employee or student, also mean that
              consent cannot be freely given.
            </p>
            <h5>
              <strong>How does consent work? </strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
              When you’re engaging in sexual activity,
              <strong> consent is about communication</strong>. And it should
              happen every time for every type of activity. Consenting to one
              activity, one time, does not mean someone gives consent for other
              activities or for the same activity on other occasions. For
              example, agreeing to kiss someone doesn’t give that person
              permission to remove your clothes. Having sex with someone in the
              past doesn’t give that person permission to have sex with you
              again in the future. It’s important to discuss boundaries and
              expectations with your partner prior to engaging in any sexual
              behavior.
            </p>
            <h5>
              <strong>You can change your mind at any time.</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
              You can withdraw consent at any point if you feel uncomfortable.
              One way to do this is to clearly communicate to your partner that
              you are no longer comfortable with this activity and wish to stop.
              Withdrawing consent can sometimes be challenging or difficult to
              do verbally, so non-verbal cues can also be used to convey this.
              The best way to ensure that all parties are comfortable with any
              sexual activity is to talk about it, check in periodically, and
              make sure everyone involved consents before escalating or changing
              activities.
            </p>
            <h5>
              <strong>What is enthusiastic consent?</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
              Enthusiastic consent is a newer model for understanding consent
              that focuses on a positive expression of consent. Simply put,
              enthusiastic consent means looking for the presence of a “yes”
              rather than the absence of a “no.” Enthusiastic consent can be
              expressed verbally or through nonverbal cues, such as positive
              body language like smiling, maintaining eye contact, and nodding.
              These cues alone do not necessarily represent consent, but they
              are additional details that may reflect consent. It is necessary,
              however, to still seek verbal confirmation. The important part of
              consent, enthusiastic or otherwise, is checking in with your
              partner regularly to make sure that they are still on the same
              page.
            </p>
            <h5>
              <strong>Enthusiastic consent can look like this:</strong>
            </h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Asking permission before you change the type or degree of
                  sexual activity with phrases like “Is this OK?”
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Confirming that there is reciprocal interest before initiating
                  any physical touch.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Letting your partner know that you can stop at any time.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Periodically checking in with your partner, such as asking “Is
                  this still okay?”
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Providing positive feedback when you’re comfortable with an
                  activity.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Explicitly agreeing to certain activities, either by saying
                  “yes” or another affirmative statement, like “I’m open to
                  trying.”
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Using physical cues to let the other person know you’re
                  comfortable taking things to the next level (see note below).
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Note: Physiological responses like an erection, lubrication,
              arousal, or orgasm are involuntary, meaning your body might react
              one way even when you are not consenting to the activity.
              Sometimes perpetrators will use the fact that these physiological
              responses occur to maintain secrecy or minimize a survivor's
              experience by using phrases such as, "You know you liked it." In
              no way does a physiological response mean that you consented to
              what happened. If you have been sexually abused or assaulted, it
              is not your fault.
