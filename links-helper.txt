Cloud Provider: AWS
MongoDB version: MongoDB 4.2


usernameDB: viibeDBaccess
passwordDB: Sgr7y4ntzcqL3Rd

database name: viibecheck <= we will continue on project with this database
database demo: School <= I am going to do some demo with this database

Run your connection string in your command line
mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster.nfkr1.mongodb.net/<dbname>" --username viibeDBaccess

=> This is how I connect to database if I replace <dbname> with viibecheck
